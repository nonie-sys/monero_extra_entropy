# monero_extra_entropy

Computers are pretty bad at creating random numbers. These can be easily predicted. We need some outside event to create an entropy pool that can be used to create real random numbers.

We use a pair of hexadecimal dice to make sure the data for our entropy pool is created from real random output. A good random number is important when creating a new monero wallet.
